# What is this?
It's a way to simulate migration flag data, so you have visualizations in your LaunchDarkly account. It will:
- Simulate reads from both an old and new source
- Simulate writes to both an old and new source
- Check for consistency on the reads when both are successful

This was created to be used with 6-stage migration flags

# How can I use it?
1. `pip install requirements.txt`
2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`
3. Replace the environment variables in `.env` with your values. Point it to a LaunchDarkly [6-stage migration flag](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/flag-types/migration-flags/creating/).
4. Ensure your flag is set to serve `shadow` to 100% of your default cohort, with no additional cohorts on top
5. `python main.py`
6. Do a keyboard interrupt (ctrl/cmd + c) when you're ready for it to stop
